
## 📄 Single-Page CV / Resume Project

### 🚀 Overview

This is a personal, single-page Curriculum Vitae (CV) or Resume built using foundational web technologies. Currently, the entire structure and styling reside within a single file, **`index.html`**, providing a simple, professional, and easily deployable online presence.

### ✨ Features

  * **Single-File Implementation:** The entire CV is contained within `index.html` for maximum simplicity and portability.
  * **Clear Structure:** Uses standard HTML elements (`div`, `h1`, `p`, `ul`, `li`, etc.) to create logical sections for **Contact**, **Skills**, **Education**, **Experience**, and **Social Networks**.
  * **Inline Styling:** Utilizes basic inline CSS (e.g., `style="color: green"`) for immediate visual distinction.
  * **Direct Links:** Includes clickable links to professional social networking profiles (LinkedIn and GitHub).

### 🛠 Technologies Used

  * **HTML5:** Defines the semantic structure and content of the CV.
  * **Inline CSS:** Provides basic color and formatting rules directly within the HTML tags.

### 📂 File Structure

The project is currently a single file:

```
/
├── index.html       // The entire CV structure and styling
└── README.md        // Project information (This file)
```

### ⚙️ Setup and Usage

Follow these simple steps to view and modify your CV:

1.  **Download:** Save the project files to your local computer.
2.  **View:** Locate the **`index.html`** file and open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3.  **Edit Content:** Open **`index.html`** in a text editor. Directly modify the text content and links within the file to update your personal details (e.g., address, skills, dates).

### 📝 To-Do / Future Enhancements

  * [ ] **Separate Styles:** Extract the inline CSS into a dedicated external file (`style.css`) to adhere to best practices (Separation of Concerns).
  * [ ] **Design Refinement:** Improve the overall layout and typography for better aesthetic appeal.
  * [ ] **Responsiveness:** Add CSS rules (media queries) to ensure the layout adapts well to mobile devices.
  * [ ] **Printer Optimization:** Implement specific CSS for print media to guarantee a clean physical/PDF copy.
